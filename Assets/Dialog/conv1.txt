1: Ahhhhh!
1: Something is off.
1: Just yesterday, I was a regular 3-dimensional person.
1: And now it somehow appears I have lost my depth.
1: This is unacceptable!
1: There is only one possible cause for this madness!
1: My neighbor Kevin!!! Any time something strange happens, you can be sure he's at fault.
1: I will go over and demand my depth back.
